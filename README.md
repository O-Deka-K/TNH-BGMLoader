# Take And Hold Background Music Loader

TNHBGML (Official acronym) is a mod for the game Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Handgrenades that supports / allows FMOD .bank swapping, allowing users to select and hotswap background music on the fly (with exception as to when the music is being used), where previously the FMOD .bank file had to be manually replaced.
